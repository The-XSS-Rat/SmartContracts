In this example, the Victim contract allows users to deposit funds and withdraw them. However, it has a critical flaw in that it does not properly check for reentrancy attacks.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling Victim.withdraw and sending funds to an instance of the Attacker contract, which in turn immediately calls Victim.withdraw again, draining all the funds.

This vulnerability is a result of the lack of proper checking for reentrancy in the Victim.withdraw function. To prevent this type of attack, it is important to implement reentrancy guards in your smart contracts. For example, you can use the require statement to check if the contract is already in the middle of an ongoing call to Victim.withdraw.
